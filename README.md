# A CentOS 7.2 Vagrant Box with Python 3.5 via Ansible

* Apache 2.4, with mod_wsgi for running Django
* FreeTDS drivers for MS SQL Server
* PostgreSQL Drivers & Server
* Node + npm

This repository contains a CentOS 7.2 box for Vagrant. Python 3.5.3 is installed alongside the system Python (2.7.5). The Vagrant config uses Ansible roles to configure the box for the development environment, that should also be suitable for setting up a production server.

MS SQL is also supported as a Django database backend with the FreeTDS ODBC Driver to SQL Server. PostgreSQL 9.6, including the server, can be install optionally for those using PostgreSQL.

Django versions 1.8 and greater are supported, however, Django 1.11 or greater is recommended at the time of this writing for new projects. Django 1.11 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release, meaning it will be actively supported with bug fixes and security patches until at least April, 2020 (and probably longer): https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions

## Compatibility & Prerequisites to Install

### Mac

* Tested with Vagrant 1.9.1: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.1/vagrant_1.9.1.dmg

* Tested on: OS/X Yosemite, and El Capitan, and Sierra.

### Linux

* Vagrant 1.9.1 can be downloaded here: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.1/
* VirtualBox 5.0.24 can be downloaded here: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.24/
* On newer machines, ensure that you have virtualization enabled in BIOS (duckduckgo it for your machine's model).

**Fedora 25, CentOS 7**

These are available via the package manager.

``` bash
$ sudo dnf install vagrant
$ sudo dnf install VirtualBox
```

### Windows

* Tested with Vagrant 1.9.1: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.1/vagrant_1.9.1.msi
* Tested with VirtualBox 5.0.24: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.24/VirtualBox-5.0.24-108355-Win.exe
* Git Bash is required, not the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe): https://git-for-windows.github.io/
    * In Git Bash, click the diamond shaped multi-colored icon in the upper left of the window, OPTIONS. You may want to go through the option list to increase your default window size, set up copy/paste shortcuts, and set up mouse selection for copy/paste.
* On newer machines, ensure that you have virtualization enabled in BIOS (Google it for your machine's model).
* Tested on: Windows 7, 8, and 10.

## Get Started

* Create and add a public SSH key to your git server (GitHub, GitLab, etc).

* Clone the repository and bring up the virtual development environment. The first time you install the box, "vagrant up" will take a little while. Grab a cup of coffee or something!
* Use a host name for your domain; for example, if you're a member of The Wharton School, you may want to use the command `VAGRANT_HOSTNAME="vagrant.wharton.upenn.edu" vagrant up` below. If you don't provide a hostname, it will be set to `vagrant.example.com`.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/wharton/python-vagrant-centos7.git
cd python-vagrant-centos7
VAGRANT_HOSTNAME="vagrant.my.domain.com" vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

**Fedora 25, CentOS 7**

Check Vagrantfile and make sure the port forwarding settings will work for
your use case. You may wish to forward the guest VM port 80 to something
other than port 80 on the host, e.g. 8888.

``` 
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8888, auto_correct: false
```

Replace the the VAGRANT_HOSTNAME line from above with the following.

```
$ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox 
```

Sit back, let the installation complete.


* You can also add the host name to your computer's `hosts` file. Your `hosts` file should be located at:

    * Mac / Linux: /etc/hosts
    * Windows: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Add this line (with the appropriate host name, if you changed it):

```
192.168.99.100  vagrant.my.domain.com
```

### Default installation creates

    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    default: SSH username: vagrant
    default: SSH auth method: private key

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

Another, less desirable, option for SSH'ing into the vagrant box..
(this requires the use of the default password, vagrant)

```
$ ssh vagrant@vagrant.my.domain.com -p 2222
```

At this point, you should change the default password for the vagrant user.
You may also want to add/remove users soon.



## Setting Up PostgreSQL & Getting Started

On your Vagrant box, a script has been provided to install PostgreSQL Server 9.6 and set up
the `vagrant` user as superuser alongside the system `postgres` user. There may be some warnings during the installation; as long as you get the correct prompt when you type `psql`, the installation worked.

```
$ sudo /vagrant/assets/install_postgres.sh
$ psql
psql (9.6.2)
Type "help" for help.

vagrant=# \?
...
vagrant=# \q
```

## Creating ERDs of Django Models

The `django-extensions` app can build handy Entity Relationship Diagrams for Django apps, even your entire project. The pre-requisites for the Python packages are included with this Vagrant box.

![An example ERD with three Django apps.](assets/users-faculty-courses.png)

First, install `django-extensions` and `pygraphviz`:

```
$ sudo pip3.5 install django-extensions pygraphviz
```

Next, add `django_extensions` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`. Then you can create the diagrams; to create a PNG of all models in your Django project.

```
$ ./manage.py graph_models -a -g -o project-erd.png
```

Or, to just do a few Django apps:

```
$ ./manage.py graph_models users faculty courses -g -o users-faculty-courses.png
```

## Windows 10: Forwarding Port 80 for Testing Apache

In Windows 10, the "World Wide Web Publishing Service" automatically starts on port 80. You can disable it so Vagrant can forward port 80.

* Click Start, type "Services" and open Services.
* Scroll down to World Wide Web Publishing Service. Right click and go into Properties.
* Change "Startup type" to be Manual.
* Click the "Stop" button.
* Click "OK".
